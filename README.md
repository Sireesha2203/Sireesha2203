## What I build
I design RESTful APIs with JWT authentication, full‑stack applications with React frontends. I focus on clean architecture, strong testing, and measurable impact.

- 🔐 Secure APIs & authentication (JWT)  
- ⚙️ Scalable backend services & data modeling (MongoDB / MySQL)  
- 🚀 Full‑stack features with React + Node / Spring Boot 
- 📊 Data-driven improvements and strong DSA foundations for robust solutions

---

## Core Strengths
- RESTful API design, JWT auth, and secure systems  
- Data Structures & Algorithms, OOP, SOLID principles  
- SQL (MySQL) & NoSQL (MongoDB) data modeling and optimization  
- Agile development, code reviews, CI/CD fundamentals, containerized apps
